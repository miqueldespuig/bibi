## What Is BIBI

Bibi is a set of *mini-projects* that I believe can give business value to the final project of my [Streaming Data Science Master at KSchool](https://kschool.com/cursos/master-en-data-science-streaming/#temario).

The scope of the master is extensive and my approach to get as much experience as possible has been to try to solve a set of initial simple projects, using as many techniques learned as possible and at the same time giving back some useful tools to [Bravissimo Girona](https://bravissimo-girona.com/en/) team, who will be the final user of this set of tools.

The projects are:
* Project 1 Gather Data.
    * Project 1.a Gather Data, Dashboard
    * Project 1.b Gather Data, NLP
* Project 2 Clean and enrich Data.
    * Project 2.a Clean-up and enrich Dashboard data for:
        * Time Series Analysis
        * NLP
        * Machine Learning
* Project 3 Business Dashboard
* Project 4 Customer Sentiment Analysis
